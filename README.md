> **An architectural fix for premature convergence in autoregressive reasoning.**

Linear Chain-of-Thought anchors on whatever it says first. Tree-of-Thought widens the search but still walks a single shared context, so the anchoring persists across branches. **ADHD treats this as an architectural problem, not a prompting one** — it spawns N isolated reasoning processes under deliberately distorted cognitive frames, with zero shared context during divergence, then runs a separate critic pass to score, cluster, prune traps, and deepen the survivors.

Reach for it on **design decisions, fuzzy debugging, naming, API surface design, strategy, and any prompt of the shape *"give me a few ways to…"***.

## Featured

- 🔌 **Adopted by [repowire](https://github.com/prassanna-ravishankar/repowire)** — the first OSS project to officially ship ADHD. Its maintainer ported the framework onto repowire's mesh-orchestrator primitives in [PR #313](https://github.com/prassanna-ravishankar/repowire/pull/313) (merged): frames become frame-shifted temp peers, the generator/critic split maps onto separate peers vs. the orchestrator's own turn, attribution via `metadata.based-on` (MIT).
- 📰 **[The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/claude-code-adhd/)** ran a feature story on ADHD for Claude Code.
- 💬 **OpenClaw / multi-agent community** is independently testing it across agents. One tester: *"I read it, installed it on two different agents… I actually love it. This is great. I thought this was gonna be another useless post. But no, it wasn't."*
- 🔬 An independent **[evidence-based research review](https://github.com/testdouble/han/blob/adhd-swarm-research/docs/research/adhd-application-to-han.md)** (11 sources, 8 validation rounds) was published against the method — findings tracked openly as [issues #16–#18](https://github.com/UditAkhourii/adhd/issues).

## Early adopters

Projects that officially ship or integrate ADHD:

| Project | What they did | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [**repowire**](https://github.com/prassanna-ravishankar/repowire) | Ported ADHD onto repowire's mesh-orchestrator primitives — frames become frame-shifted temp peers, generator/critic split maps to separate peers vs. the orchestrator's turn. Ships in the default orchestrator template. ([PR #313](https://github.com/prassanna-ravishankar/repowire/pull/313)) | ✅ Merged · MIT attribution |

## Install

One command, auto-detects your agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Antigravity, Codex, Cline, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, and ~50 more):

```bash
npx skills add UditAkhourii/adhd
```

Then invoke explicitly with `/adhd "your problem"`, or let it auto-trigger on ideation intents. CLI and library installs, manual curl, and per-platform paths are in **[documentation/install.md](./documentation/install.md)**.

```bash
npm install -g adhd-agent     # CLI
npm install adhd-agent        # library
```

---

## Quickstart

```bash
adhd "design a rate limiter that survives a leader election"
adhd "name this function" --frames 3 --ideas 8 --top 2
```

```ts
import { run, renderText } from "adhd-agent";

const result = await run({ problem: "How should we shard this queue under bursty load?", framesPerRun: 5, topK: 3 });
console.log(renderText(result));
// result.shortlist · result.nonObviousPick · result.traps · result.deepened · result.clusters
```

Full reference: **[documentation/api.md](./documentation/api.md)**.

## How it works

A two-phase loop with a hard wall between the phases.

1. **Diverge.** Pick N cognitive frames. Spawn N parallel, **isolated** Agent calls — each sees the problem plus one frame's vantage prompt, and a system prompt that forbids evaluation. Branches never see each other, so no anchoring.
2. **Focus.** A separate critic call scores every idea (`novelty / viability / fit`), flags traps with reasons, clusters by underlying angle, and deepens the top-K survivors into sketches with risks and first steps.

The generator-critic split is **mechanical** — separate LLM calls with opposite system prompts — not promised in one prompt. Deep dive: **[documentation/how-it-works.md](./documentation/how-it-works.md)**. How it differs from CoT and ToT: **[documentation/vs-cot-and-tot.md](./documentation/vs-cot-and-tot.md)**.

## Results

Mean scores across 6 open-ended engineering problems (0–10), ADHD vs a single-shot baseline at the same model, judged by an independent LLM with a skeptical-staff-engineer prompt, A/B order randomized.

| Dimension          | ADHD     | Baseline | Δ         | Ratio |
| ------------------ | -------: | -------: | --------: | ----: |
| breadth            | **9.00** | 4.83     | **+4.17** | 1.9×  |
| novelty            | **7.83** | 2.67     | **+5.17** | 2.9×  |
| trap detection     | **9.50** | 1.83     | **+7.67** | 5.2×  |
| actionability      | **9.50** | 6.50     | **+3.00** | 1.5×  |
| builder usefulness | **7.67** | 6.83     | **+0.83** | 1.1×  |

**ADHD wins 5 of 6 problems.** Biggest gap is trap detection — baselines rarely name the seductive-but-broken ideas. Methodology, limitations, and how to reproduce: **[documentation/evals.md](./documentation/evals.md)**.
